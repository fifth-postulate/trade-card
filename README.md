# Trade Card
Application to keep track of the cards in your collection.

## Client
A client can be found in the `client` directory. It is written in [Elm][elm]. In
order to build the system move into the directory and execute the following
command

```plain
elm make src/TradeCard/Client.elm --output js/client.js 
```

This will update `client.js` with the latest developments. To see the trade card
app in action open `index.html` in your browser.
